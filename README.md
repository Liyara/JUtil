# JUtil
JUtil is written to be a replacement for the standard C++ library, built on top the the standard C library. It is not intedned as a viable alternative, however, merely as a proof-of-concept project developed for personal use in my own projects. 

All of my personal programming projects, written in C++, will depend on this library. The purpose of this is to give me the ability to give my C++ code a foundation which I understand more deeply, and therefire, hopefully, increase code efficiancy and decrease bugs. 

That being said, this library is open source, under the MIT license (see LICENSE), and therefore is free of use, under the conditions specified by LICENSE, to anybody who would want to use it.
